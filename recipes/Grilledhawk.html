<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>The Grilled Tomahawk Steak is an impressive and indulgent dish that is perfect for special occasions or when you want to treat yourself to a truly flavorful experience. This recipe features a thick-cut, bone-in ribeye steak that is known for its exceptional tenderness and rich marbling. The steak gets its name from the long rib bone left intact, resembling a tomahawk axe handle.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 Tomahawk steak (about 2 pounds)</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Any other desired spices or dry rub</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your grill to high heat for a perfect sear.</li>
    <li>Season the tomahawk steak generously with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and any desired spices or dry rub. Let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place the seasoned tomahawk steak directly over the flame on the hot grill. Sear each side for a few minutes until a beautiful char forms, giving the steak that irresistible smoky flavor.</li>
    <li>Move the steak to a cooler part of the grill or reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches your desired level of doneness. For a medium-rare steak, aim for an internal temperature of around 130°F (54°C).</li>
    <li>Once grilled to perfection, remove the tomahawk steak from the heat and let it rest for about 10 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicy and tender steak.</li>
    <li>After resting, slice the tomahawk steak against the grain into thick, luscious pieces. Serve it with your favorite sides like roasted potatoes, grilled vegetables, or a fresh green salad.</li>
</ol>
