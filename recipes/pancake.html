Made with simple ingredients like flour, sugar, baking powder, buttermilk, and eggs, these pancakes are incredibly fluffy and flavorful.</p><p> The recipe begins by combining the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another, followed by a gentle mix to create a smooth batter.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
   <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li> 3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>Optional: Additional ingredients for flavor variations, such as blueberries, chocolate chips, or sliced bananas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter until well blended.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>
    <li>Optional: If adding any flavor variations, gently fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with butter or cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve the pancakes warm, stacked on a plate, and accompanied by maple syrup, honey, fresh fruits, or any toppings of your choice.</li>
  </ol>
